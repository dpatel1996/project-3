    to helping someone in need, I would love to do that. I am always willing to learn new skills and develop to the best of my potential.</p>

    <p> I like to live a very simple life along with working hard for my goals and getting it through achievemets. My favourite class is math, which I love to do
    and I never get bored. Focus and hard work always pay off at the right time, which I have experienced. </p>

    shows and also love listening to bollywood songs and few hollywood songs. I like to travel different places across the world. I have dream of going to Manchester United 
    soccer stadium to watch and feel the live ambience also known as Theatre of Dreams. </p>
